## About Us

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
    Founded in late 2019, our vision at Zoom Lab is to create robots that can mechanically conform to the environment or objects that they interact with to alleviate the need for high-speed, high-accuracy, and high-precision controllers. We pursue this goal by developing compliant mechanisms for manipulators and robots, focusing on bio-inspiration and unconventional materials, and engaging with the community to increase interest in science and engineering.
</p>

We are a part of the [Robotics Insitute](https://ri.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu). 


We are looking to expand our team. If you're interested, read about our [open positions]()! To get more information about research and facilities, [click here](/research).

Feel free to stop by our lab in Wean 1302 to see our amazing robots in action!
